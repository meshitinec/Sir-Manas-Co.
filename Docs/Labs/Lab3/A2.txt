Problems : 
1. there's no explanation about which event makes the screeen appear 
2. there's no explanation of menu, button, entiry field action mechanisms 
3. there's no actors and functionality needed by users. 

Benefits : 
1. screenshots helps us to analyse and avoid problems of subject which would be developed at the end. 
2. it also helps us not to makes mistakes , not to forget destination of each button, function etc. , and to explain our aim to customer.
